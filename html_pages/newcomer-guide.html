  <h1>Newcomer’s Guide to Healthcare, Privacy, and Jobs in Canada</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Problem with Language Barriers</h2>
    <p>People who don’t speak English or French well may get worse healthcare. When doctors and patients can’t understand each other, it can lead to mistakes. For example, a patient’s private health details might be shared with the wrong person, or a patient might agree to a treatment they don’t fully understand.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Healthcare: Why Language Matters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask for a professional interpreter at hospitals or clinics (it’s your right!).</li>
      <li>Learn key health words in English/French (e.g., “pain,” “allergy”).</li>
      <li>Use free language classes like LINC/CLIC (see resources below).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Privacy Policies: Don’t Get Tricked</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Always ask someone you trust to translate privacy forms.</li>
      <li>Check what data is collected, who gets it, and what the risks are before signing.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Jobs: Why Language Skills Are Key</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Take free government language classes (LINC/CLIC).</li>
      <li>Practice job-specific terms (e.g., “customer service,” “safety training”).</li>
      <li>Attend workshops at newcomer centers for résumé and interview skills.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Free Language Classes: Your Path to Success</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Learning English or French helps with healthcare, employment, and privacy.</li>
      <li>Permanent residents and protected persons qualify for free classes.</li>
      <li>Search for nearby courses on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/settle-canada/language-skills/classes.html" target="_blank">Canada.ca</a> or ask local organizations like the <a href="https://www.ymcagta.org/immigrant-services" target="_blank">YMCA</a>.</li>
